# lot-tracker
A Meat Packing Company must write down the lot numbers for each of their ingredients to be sent to the government for inspection. This can get very tedious being handwritten, especially when most of the lot numbers repeat themselves. Lot-Tracker is a Java program to print the lot numbers write onto the excel recipe sheet.
## How It Works
### Adding a Lot Number
Clicking the Add Lot Number button will bring up a dialogue to input the ingredient name and lot number to be put into the excel file

### Updating a Recipe File
Clicking the Update Recipe button will begin with a friendly reminder that the excel file will not update while it is open. This reminder can also be shut off.

After a decision is made, the file chooser will show up to open the excel file

Open up the recipe file and you will see the lot numbers updated next to the corresponding ingredient!
