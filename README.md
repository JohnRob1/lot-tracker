# lot-tracker
A meat packing company has to write down the lot numbers of all of their ingredients to keep track of freshness and then turn the paperwork into the state. Many of these repeat and need to be handwritten onto a printed recipe excel sheet. This can become very time consuming as the make multiple recipes a day. The goal of this program is to have the customer input the lot number and each ingredient once, read the excel sheet to identify the ingredients, and then place the lot numbers into the excel sheet so they can be printed.
